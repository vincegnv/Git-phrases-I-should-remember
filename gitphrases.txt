GIT commands I have needed.

	Initializing a new repository:
$ git init

	Setting an remote:
$ git remote add origin git://github.com/username/repository.git
	or if origin is already set and we want to redirect it:
$ git remote set-url origin git://github.com/username/repository.git
	or if we want to redirect only the push URL:
$git remote set-url --push origin git://github.com/username/repository.git

Commit singe file from one branch to another:
  $ git checkout branch1
  $ git checkout branch2 file
Commits file (must include file path) from branch1 to branch2.
